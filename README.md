# Computing Distance and Entropy Measures for Purified Quantum States
The repository contains the code and the report of my fabrication of a program that computes the distance measures (Fidelity and Trace Distance) along with Von Neumann Entropy between two states as they evolve under an input Hamiltonian. These states can also be viewed as a purfication of two difference mixed systems , the scheme of which has also been encoded.

I have opted to use numpy instead of working in QuTiP so that I have a better understanding of the mathematics employed in quantum calculations.
